# lpl
List Programming Language is based around a Python List<br>
It works a bit like a stack where it is a first in last out<br>

# Keywords
These are all the keywords 
```
assign - assign a value to a store
add - add all the elements in the list
sub - subtract all the elements in the list
mul - multiply all the elements in the list
div - divide all the elements in the list
push - add an element to the list
pop - remove an element from the list
clear - clear the list
echo - print to stdout
read - read from stdin
```
We also have "registers" to put results or store things
```
[result] - get the result of the last command (immutable)
[list] - get the list (immutable)
[store_a] - 1st general store (mutable)
[store_b] - 2nd general store (mutable)
[store_c] - 3rd general store (mutable)

[store_e] - 5th general store (mutable)
[store_f] - 6th general store (mutable)
```
