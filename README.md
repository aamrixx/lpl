# lpl
Little Programming Language is based around Assembly (nothing like Assembly).<br>
It is a bit like a high level assembly or something else.<br>

# Keywords
These are all the keywords.
```
run - Run another lpl script
assign - assign a value to a store
constant - A constant for storing randomness
add - add 2 numbers
sub - subtract 2 numbers
mul - multiply 2 numbers
div - divide 2 numbers

We also have "registers" to put results or store things.
```
[result] - get the result of the last command (immutable)
[store_a] - 1st general store (mutable)
[store_b] - 2nd general store (mutable)
[store_c] - 3rd general store (mutable)
[store_d] - 4th general store (mutable)
[store_e] - 5th general store (mutable)
[store_f] - 6th general store (mutable)
```
